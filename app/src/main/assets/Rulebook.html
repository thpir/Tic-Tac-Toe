		<p>You probably already know how to play Tic-Tac-Toe. It's a really simple game, right? That's what most people think. But if you really wrap your brain around it, you'll discover that Tic-Tac-Toe isn't quite as simple as you think!</p>
		<p>Tic-Tac -Toe (along with a lot of other games) involves looking ahead and trying to figure out what the person playing against you might do next.</P>

		<h2>Rules for TIC-TAC-TOE</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.</li>
			<li>You are <strong>X</strong>, your friend (or the computer in this case) is <strong>O</strong>. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares. </li>
			<li>The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner. </li>
			<li>When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.</li>

		<h2>How can I win at TIC-TAC-TOE?</h2>
		<p>To beat the computer (or at least tie), you need to make use of a little bit of strategy. Strategy means figuring out what you need to do to win.</P>
		<p>Part of your strategy is trying to figure out how to get three <strong>X</strong>s in a row. The other part is trying to figure out how to stop the computer from getting three <strong>O</strong>s in a row.</P>
		<p>After you put an <strong>X</strong> in a square, you start looking ahead. Where's the best place for your next <strong>X</strong>? You look at the empty squares and decide which ones are good choicesâ€”which ones might let you make three <strong>X</strong>s in a row.</P>
		<p>You also have to watch where the computer puts its <strong>O</strong>. That could change what you do next. If the computer gets two <strong>O</strong>s in a row, you <em>have</em> to put your next <strong>X</strong> in the last empty square in that row, or the computer will win. You are forced to play in a particular square or lose the game.</P>
		<p>If you always pay attention and look ahead, you'll never lose a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. You may not win, but at least you'll tie.</P>
